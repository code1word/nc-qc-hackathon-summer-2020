# NC Quantum Computing Hackathon Summer 2020

Hello! We are the NCSSM Unicorns, and for our Quantum Hackathon project, we have implemented a cubic spline generator, integrating features of Qiskit along the way. Cubic splines are useful for the approximation of complex curves and have applications in numerous areas such as statistics, computer graphics, image processing, aeronautical engineering, and many more. The objective of our project is two-fold; we first implement a quantum function that generates random points within a specified range on a target curve. We then generate a smooth curve that passes through this set of points via a cubic spline interpolation to approximate the target curve.
